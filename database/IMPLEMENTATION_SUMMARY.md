# Database Schema Implementation Summary

## Task Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 1: "Set up enhanced database schema and user management" from the media tracking platform specification.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migration Files Created
- **001_create_user_profiles.sql** - User profiles and preferences tables
- **002_create_media_tables.sql** - Media items and user media tracking tables  
- **003_create_social_features.sql** - Reviews, likes, follows, and activity feed tables

### 2. Enhanced Type Definitions
- **database.types.ts** - Updated with complete schema definitions for all new tables
- **src/types/database.ts** - Application-specific TypeScript interfaces and types
- **src/lib/supabase.ts** - Enhanced Supabase client with helper functions

### 3. Database Schema Features

#### User Management
- **user_profiles**: Extended user information with privacy controls
- **user_preferences**: User settings and notification preferences
- Automatic profile creation on user registration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data privacy

#### Media Tracking
- **media_items**: Unified table for all media types (movies, TV, books, anime)
- **user_media**: User's personal lists with status tracking
- Automatic rating calculations and aggregations
- Full-text search capabilities

#### Social Features
- **reviews**: Detailed user reviews with ratings
- **review_likes**: Like system for reviews
- **user_follows**: User following relationships
- **user_activities**: Activity feed for social interactions

### 4. Row Level Security Implementation
All tables have comprehensive RLS policies that:
- Protect user privacy based on their settings
- Allow public access to appropriate content
- Enforce proper authorization for all operations
- Support social features while maintaining security

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Strategic database indexes for common queries
- Full-text search indexes for media titles
- Optimized queries for user lists and activities
- Efficient relationship lookups

### 6. Developer Tools
- **scripts/apply-migrations.js** - Migration helper script
- **database/README.md** - Comprehensive documentation
- **npm run db:help** - Easy access to migration instructions
- Type-safe database operations with helper functions

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.1**: User authentication and registration system
- Enhanced user profiles with automatic creation
- Secure authentication flow with Supabase Auth

✅ **Requirement 1.2**: User account creation and management
- User profiles with customizable information
- Privacy controls and preferences

✅ **Requirement 1.3**: Form validation and error handling
- Database constraints and validation
- Type-safe operations with proper error handling

✅ **Requirement 7.1**: Data privacy and user control
- Comprehensive RLS policies
- Privacy level controls for user data

✅ **Requirement 7.4**: Data protection standards
- Encrypted sensitive information via Supabase
- Proper data cleanup on account deletion

## Database Tables Created

| Table | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| user_profiles | User information | Privacy controls, automatic creation |
| user_preferences | User settings | Notification and visibility preferences |
| media_items | All media content | Unified schema, rating aggregation |
| user_media | Personal lists | Status tracking, progress monitoring |
| reviews | Detailed reviews | Rating system, spoiler warnings |
| review_likes | Social interactions | Like/unlike functionality |
| user_follows | Social connections | Following relationships |
| user_activities | Activity feed | Automatic activity tracking |

## Next Steps

To apply these database changes:

1. **Run the migration helper**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:help
   ```

2. **Apply migrations via Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Copy each migration file content
   - Execute in SQL Editor in order (001, 002, 003)

3. **Verify implementation**:
   - Check tables are created
   - Test user registration flow
   - Verify RLS policies are active

4. **Update application code**:
   - Import new types from `src/types/database.ts`
   - Use enhanced Supabase client from `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Implement components using the new schema

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `database/migrations/001_create_user_profiles.sql`
- `database/migrations/002_create_media_tables.sql`
- `database/migrations/003_create_social_features.sql`
- `database/README.md`
- `database/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `src/types/database.ts`
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- `scripts/apply-migrations.js`

### Modified Files
- `database.types.ts` - Added new table definitions
- `package.json` - Added migration scripts
- Removed `src/lib/supabase.js` (replaced with TypeScript version)

## Technical Highlights

- **Comprehensive RLS**: Every table has appropriate security policies
- **Automatic Triggers**: Profile creation, rating updates, activity tracking
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generated types
- **Performance**: Strategic indexing and query optimization
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented schema with helper functions
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growth in users and content

The database schema is now ready to support the full media tracking platform with user management, social features, and comprehensive privacy controls.
