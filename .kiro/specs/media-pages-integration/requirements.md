# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The media tracking platform has been successfully implemented with comprehensive search, user management, and social features. However, the individual media pages (anime, movies, books) are still using outdated static components that don't integrate with the new dynamic functionality. Users cannot properly browse media content, add items to their lists, or navigate to detail pages from these category pages. This feature will modernize these pages to use the implemented search and media management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Media Category Pages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse movies, anime, and books on their respective category pages with dynamic content, so that I can discover and interact with media items effectively.

2. WHEN a user visits /anime THEN the system SHALL display popular and trending anime using the search API  
3. WHEN a user visits /books THEN the system SHALL display popular and trending books using the search API
4. WHEN media items are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the MediaCard component for consistent presentation
5. WHEN a user clicks on a media item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the proper media detail page
6. IF the external APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options

### Requirement 2: Integrated Add-to-List Functionality

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to add media items to my lists directly from the category pages, so that I can quickly manage my media tracking without navigating to detail pages.

2. WHEN a user clicks "Add to List" THEN the system SHALL show status options (Plan to Watch/Read, Watching/Reading, Completed, etc.)
3. WHEN a user selects a status THEN the system SHALL save the item to their media list with the chosen status
4. WHEN a user has already added an item THEN the system SHALL show their current status instead of "Add to List"
5. WHEN a user changes an item's status THEN the system SHALL update their list immediately
6. IF a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL show login prompts when attempting to add items

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter media within each category page, so that I can find specific content more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on a category page THEN the system SHALL display a search bar specific to that media type
2. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL filter results to show only matching items of that media type
3. WHEN a user applies filters (genre, year, rating) THEN the system SHALL update the displayed results accordingly
4. WHEN search results are empty THEN the system SHALL display helpful suggestions and allow clearing filters
5. WHEN a user clears search/filters THEN the system SHALL return to showing popular/trending content
6. WHEN search is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design and Performance

2. WHEN a user scrolls down THEN the system SHALL implement infinite scroll to load more content
3. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading and show skeleton placeholders

5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL cache API responses to improve subsequent load times
6. IF network is slow THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading states

### Requirement 5: Navigation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear navigation and consistent user experience across all category pages, so that I can easily move between different media types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any category page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current category in the navigation
2. WHEN a user switches between category pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent layout and functionality
3. WHEN a user clicks on media items THEN the system SHALL navigate to detail pages with proper URLs (/media/movie/123)
